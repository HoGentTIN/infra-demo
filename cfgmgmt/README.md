# Demo environment: Configuration management with Ansible

Based on [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton), an opinionated skeleton for setting up reproducible Vagrant/Ansible environments.

Goal of this demo:

- How to define hosts and specify their names and IP addresses
- Explain the directory structure of a typical Ansible project
- Write a playbook to install a database server
- Use a pre-existing Ansible role to install a web server
